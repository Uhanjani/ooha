  <br> <strong><ins>1. Mock Theta Functions and Quantum Black Holes:</ins></stong></br>
    Ramanujan's mock theta functions, discovered in his "Lost Notebook," have found unexpected applications in the study of quantum black holes. In particular, certain properties of these functions have been utilized in understanding the entropy of black holes. The connection between number theory, modular forms, and quantum physics in this context is a remarkable example of the unexpected utility of Ramanujan's work.
    
   <strong><ins>2. Modular Forms and Conformal Field Theory:</ins></strong>
    Modular forms, a subject Ramanujan extensively contributed to, have applications in conformal field theory, a branch of quantum physics. Conformal field theory describes critical points in statistical mechanics and has connections to quantum mechanics. The modular properties of certain functions play a role in the study of symmetries and transformations in these physical systems.
    
    <strong><ins>3. Theta Functions and Quantum Field Theory:</ins></strong>
    Theta functions, another area of Ramanujan's mathematical contributions, have applications in quantum field theory. Quantum field theory is a fundamental framework in modern particle physics. The properties of theta functions have been employed in the study of string theory and certain aspects of quantum field interactions.
    
  <strong><ins>4. Partition Functions and Statistical Mechanics:</ins></strong>
    Ramanujan's work on partition functions and mock theta functions has implications in statistical mechanics, a field closely related to quantum physics. Partition functions describe the statistical properties of physical systems, and Ramanujan's findings in this area have been applied to understand the behavior of certain quantum systems.
    
    <strong><ins>5.Modular Equations and String Theory:</ins></strong>
    Ramanujan's contributions to modular equations have connections to string theory, a theoretical framework in quantum physics that describes the fundamental building blocks of the universe as one-dimensional "strings." Modular forms and equations appear in the study of certain symmetries and structures within string theory.
    
   <strong><ins>6. Influence on Mathematicians Working in Physics:</ins></strong>
    While not a direct application, Ramanujan's work has inspired mathematicians and physicists alike. His deep insights into number theory, modular forms, and related areas have influenced the development of mathematical tools and frameworks used by physicists in their theoretical work, including in quantum physics.
    
    In essence, Ramanujan's mathematical legacy, though rooted in pure mathematics, has permeated into theoretical physics, providing tools and insights that have found applications in understanding the quantum world. The unexpected connections between Ramanujan's mathematical discoveries and quantum physics highlight the profound and interconnected nature of these fields.
