        This infinite product converges rapidly, providing an efficient way to approximate the value of π.
        
        2. Ramanujan's Master Theorem:
        Ramanujan developed a master theorem for rapidly converging infinite series. One notable instance is his formula for the reciprocal of the number 
        �
        e (the base of the natural logarithm):

        4. Ramanujan's Theta Functions:
        Ramanujan introduced theta functions, which are special functions used in the theory of modular forms. His work on theta functions included various infinite series and continued fractions representations. These functions have applications in diverse areas of mathematics, including number theory and analysis.
        
        5. Ramanujan's Modular Equations:
        Ramanujan derived modular equations connecting elliptic integrals and modular forms. These equations often involve infinite series and continued fractions, and they play a crucial role in the study of elliptic functions and modular forms.
        
        Ramanujan's work in infinite series and continued fractions was characterized by its elegance and efficiency, providing mathematicians with new tools and insights into the nature of these mathematical structures. His contributions in these areas continue to be influential and are studied by mathematicians worldwide.</h2></body></html>
