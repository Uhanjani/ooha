    <body><h3><br>Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematician, made remarkable contributions to infinite series and continued fractions. One of his notable achievements was providing alternative representations for mathematical constants.<br></h3>
            <pre style="font-size: larger;">
        Ramanujan's exploration of π yielded an interesting infinite product formula. The reciprocal of π is expressed as the product of nested square roots, leading to a rapidly converging series. This formula showcased his ability to derive unconventional yet efficient representations for well-known constants.
        
        The Ramanujan Master Theorem, a general formula he developed, is particularly noteworthy. It encompasses various rapidly converging infinite series. One application of this theorem is seen in the calculation of the reciprocal of the mathematical constant 
        
        e. The resulting series converges rapidly, offering a powerful tool for numerical computations.
        
        Continuing his work on 
        e, Ramanujan discovered an elegant continued fraction representation for this mathematical constant. The continued fraction, with its recursive structure, provides an alternative expression for
        e and converges rapidly, highlighting Ramanujan's knack for uncovering concise mathematical forms.
        
        Ramanujan's engagement with theta functions extended his influence to elliptic integrals. He derived new series representations and established connections between theta functions and elliptic integrals, contributing to the broader field of elliptic functions.
        
        His fascination with infinite series extended to π, where he uncovered several series representations. These formulas, often involving square roots and fractions, demonstrated his ability to manipulate mathematical entities to reveal concise expressions.
        
        Ramanujan's contributions were not merely about calculations but also about discerning patterns and relationships in mathematical expressions. His work, characterized by unusual and beautiful identities, showcased a unique blend of creativity and mathematical intuition. Overall, Ramanujan's legacy in infinite series and continued fractions continues to inspire mathematicians and remains a testament to his extraordinary mathematical prowess.</pre></body></html>
