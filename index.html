<center><img src="sr.jpg"></center>
<pre style="font-size:25px">
Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions during the early 20th century. He was born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, a small town in Tamil Nadu, India, and he passed away on April 26, 1920, in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu.

Ramanujan displayed an early aptitude for mathematics and independently developed many theorems and results without any formal training. He gained recognition after sending a letter to the renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy, along with a sample of his work, in 1913. Hardy, impressed by Ramanujan's talent, invited him to Cambridge University in England.

Ramanujan's time in England, from 1914 to 1919, was marked by collaboration with Hardy and other mathematicians. Despite facing challenges adjusting to the English academic culture and experiencing health issues, Ramanujan produced a substantial body of work. His contributions include results in areas such as modular forms, mock theta functions, elliptic functions, and partition functions.

In 1918, Ramanujan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his extraordinary contributions to mathematics. However, his health continued to decline, and he returned to India in 1919. Tragically, Ramanujan's life was cut short when he died at the age of 32 in 1920, likely due to complications arising from tuberculosis.

Ramanujan left behind notebooks containing a wealth of mathematical discoveries, many of which were not fully understood until later mathematicians delved into his work. His legacy continues to influence various branches of mathematics, and he is celebrated as one of the greatest mathematical minds in history. The story of his life has inspired numerous books, documentaries, and a feature film titled "The Man Who Knew Infinity."</pre>
