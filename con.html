When Hardy visited Ramanujan in the hospital and mentioned that he took a taxi with the unremarkable number 1729, Ramanujan immediately replied that 1729 is an interesting number as it is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways (1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3). This story highlights Ramanujan's deep insights into number theory.</p></body></html>
